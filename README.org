This is a fairly small recreation of The Evolution of Trust by ncase in a
library format written in Rust.

A brief documentation can be generated using ~cargo doc --open~.

This library, originally in C#, was one of the very things I ever wrote. As I
got aquainted with Rust, I did this rewrite for old time's sake.  Aimed as an
answer to a certain one day challenge.

Features, License and more information can be found in Cargo.toml.
